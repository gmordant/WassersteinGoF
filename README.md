# WassersteinGoF

## Usage 

This package helps to perform goodness-of-fit tests relying on the Wasserstein (p=1,2) distance. 
The functions have been used in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.06684.pdf. 

Have a look at the Temp/Examples.R for a first example of certain functions to test the null hypothesis that the data is Gaussian.


## Installation 
To install the package from R you must use the two following lines.

library(devtools)

install_github("gmordant/WassersteinGoF", ref = "main")

Somtimes, you need to update some packages in the process. Accept it and restart the R session before trying to use 'WassersteinGoF'.
 

Note: This package was succesfully tested on MacOS and Ubuntu.
