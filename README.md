# WassersteinGoF

This package helps to perform goodness-of-fit tests relying on the Wasserstein (p=1,2) distance. 
Have a look at the Temp/Examples.R for an example for Gaussian data.

Recall that to install the package from R you must use the two following lines.

library(devtools)
install_github("gmordant/WassersteinGoF", ref = "main")

Note: package built and tested on a Mac.
